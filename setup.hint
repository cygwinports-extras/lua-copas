ldesc: "Copas is a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by 
TCP/IP servers. It uses LuaSocket as the interface with the TCP/IP 
stack.

A server registered with Copas should provide a handler for requests and 
use Copas socket functions to send the response. Copas loops through 
requests and invokes the corresponding handlers."
